## Task 1: Image to Pencil Sketch with Python
* We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.

## Task 2: Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM:
* This a Beginner Level Task which deals with the Stock Market Dataset. 
* In this task we need to predict stock price and forecasting it using stacked LSTM.
* Dataset Used : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwitiderrick/stockprice/master/NSE-TATAGLOBAL.csv

## Develop A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting
* This a Advance Level Task which deals with the neural network machine learning project with the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge and using Tensorflow and CNN. 
* It has a very user-friendly interface thatâ€™s ideal for beginners.
